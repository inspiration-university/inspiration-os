# Vision Mapping

This is not about setting goals — it’s about illuminating the future that wants to emerge through you.

## Instructions
- Draw a mind-map of your ideal life: relationships, work, health, art, etc.
- Write a 1-page letter from your future self.
- Keep it visible and review weekly.

## Prompts
- “What excites me, even if I don’t know how to do it yet?”
- “What kind of world do I want to help create?”

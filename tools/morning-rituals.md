# Morning Rituals

The way you begin your day shapes everything. Design rituals that connect you to your presence, purpose, and possibility.

## Components
- Silence (meditation, prayer, nature).
- Movement (stretching, yoga, walk).
- Expression (journaling, music, speaking aloud).
- Alignment (review your vision, values, intentions).

> "Win the morning, win the day."

# Shadow Work

You can't build a cathedral on a shaky foundation. Shadow work is the process of reclaiming parts of yourself you’ve hidden, rejected, or disowned.

## Prompts
- “What do I judge most in others?”
- “When did I last feel ashamed, and why?”
- “What am I pretending not to know?”

## Ritual
- Set aside 30 minutes with no distractions.
- Light a candle or use symbolic grounding (e.g., a stone, a journal).
- Be honest, kind, and curious.

> The shadow holds the keys to your personal power.

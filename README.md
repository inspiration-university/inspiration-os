## What is the Prometheus Kernel?

The **Prometheus Kernel** is the foundational codebase for building personalized belief systems, self-mythologies, and creative frameworks. It’s the heart of the **Inspiration-OS** — an open-source initiative to distribute meaning, beauty, and inner fire at scale.

This project is for dreamers, makers, rebels, and gods-in-disguise.

You are not here to follow.  
You are here to *create*.

## Why "Prometheus"?

In Greek mythology, Prometheus stole fire from the gods and gifted it to humanity. He was punished, of course — because fire is power. Creativity. Consciousness.

This kernel follows in his footsteps — not to destroy old systems, but to offer *a better one*. A system where inspiration isn’t locked behind institutions or personalities, but distributed, decentralized, and deeply personal.

## Features

🔥 **Build Your Own Mythos**  
Define your values, archetypes, rituals, goals, and core stories.

🧠 **Modular Design**  
Include only what resonates. Swap out modules. Create your own "distro" (e.g., CreatorOS, CalmOS, WarriorOS, etc.).

🔔 **Integrated Practices**  
Support for rituals, reminders, affirmations, journaling prompts, audio cues, and more.

🌍 **Open-Source Spirituality**  
Not a religion. Not a cult. Just a framework for living *on fire* with purpose, truth, and creativity.

👤 **Pseudonymous Safe Spaces**  
Build under your real name or a chosen persona. Inspired by Satoshi. Supported by shadow.

Inspiration isn’t scarce. It’s just badly distributed.  
Let’s change that — one fire-starter at a time.

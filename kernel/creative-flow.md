# Creative Flow

Creativity is your natural state when fear is quiet and curiosity is alive.

## Core Principles
- Flow is more important than perfection.
- Every idea is a doorway â€” follow the ones that feel alive.
- Blocked creativity often points to blocked emotion.

## Practices
- Daily 20-minute unfiltered freewriting or sketching.
- Try the "10 Bad Ideas" exercise to unlock unconventional thinking.
- Use novelty (new places, new people) as creative fuel.

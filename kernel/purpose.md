# Purpose

Purpose is your internal compass. It doesn't need to be grand or flashy. It only needs to be true.

## Core Principles
- Purpose emerges when you align your values with your actions.
- It evolves over time — listen and adjust.
- Purpose isn’t a job title, it’s a state of commitment.

## Practices
- Write a “Why I’m Here” paragraph every 3 months.
- Regularly audit your calendar for alignment with your values.
- Imagine your 85-year-old self: what would they be proud of?

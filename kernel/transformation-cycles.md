# Transformation Cycles

Inspiration is not static — it evolves in cycles of expansion and integration.

## Core Principles
- Life moves in spirals, not straight lines.
- Each descent is the start of a new ascent.
- Letting go is a skill. Practice it.

## Practices
- Journaling prompts: “What am I shedding?”, “What am I stepping into?”
- Celebrate completions, not just beginnings.
- Use setbacks as signals for recalibration.

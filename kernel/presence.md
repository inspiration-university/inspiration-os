# Presence

Presence is the foundation of any inspired life. It is the ability to fully inhabit the current moment — the only place where life is actually happening.

## Core Principles
- The present moment is the only real moment.
- Anxiety lives in the future. Regret lives in the past. Freedom lives in presence.
- Attention is your most precious resource. Train it like a muscle.

## Practices
- Daily body scans to reconnect with your senses.
- Silence your phone for one hour per day.
- Try the “5-4-3-2-1” grounding technique when feeling overwhelmed.
